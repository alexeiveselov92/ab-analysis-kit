# Changelog

All notable changes to ab-analysis-kit will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Once implementation begins, `CHANGELOG.md` is **authoritative for behavior changes**
— in particular every statistical deviation from the captured legacy baseline is
recorded here alongside an `ALGORITHM_VERSION` bump and a
[`statistics-changes.md`](docs/specs/statistics-changes.md) entry (never a silent
number change).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **M1 — the pure statistical core `abkit.stats`** (importable standalone;
  numpy/scipy/statsmodels only). Data model: `Sample` / `Fraction` /
  `RatioSample`, sufficient statistics with the exact legacy **mixed-ddof**
  convention (`np.var`→ddof=0, `np.cov`→ddof=1), `JointMoments`,
  `PairedSufficientStats`, Welford/Chan-stable merges (`accumulate`). Plugin
  method registry + factory + canonical `method_config_id`
  (sha256 over registry name + sorted non-default identity params, version
  appended only when >1; byte-exact-tested; `seed` identity-excluded).
  Closed-form methods (`t-test`, `paired-t-test`, `z-test`, `cuped-t-test`,
  `paired-cuped-t-test`, the new `ratio-delta`) with dual entry
  (`from_samples` ≡ `from_suffstats`); bootstrap family (`bootstrap`,
  `paired-bootstrap`, `poisson-bootstrap`, `paired-poisson-bootstrap`,
  `post-normed-bootstrap`, `paired-post-normed-bootstrap`) on a vectorised
  block-streaming engine with deterministic per-seed draws. Power/MDE
  (t-test, CUPED-deflated, proportions), Bonferroni (incl. the legacy
  two-tier scheme) + read-time Benjamini-Hochberg, SRM chi-square gate,
  deterministic seed derivation (`rng.derive_seed`).
- **Tests (760+):** golden tests vs an independent transcription of the legacy
  engine at rel-1e-9 (incl. the CUPED θ golden and a heavy-tailed sparse-revenue
  fixture), byte-exact identity-hash tests, bootstrap byte-stability /
  block-invariance tests, quarantine and known-answer tests
  (`ratio-delta` ≡ `t-test` at denominator ≡ 1), A/A calibration smoke.

### Changed
- Engine-hygiene fixes H1–H10 applied per
  [`statistics-changes.md` §7](docs/specs/statistics-changes.md) (M1
  implementation record): Generator-based RNG, plug-in bootstrap p-value by
  default (`pvalue_kind: sign` keeps baseline parity), Hamilton stratum
  apportionment, Poisson mean-only guard, H5 zero-denominator NaN+warning
  policy, H9 point-estimate effect convention; broken legacy ratio methods
  quarantined (never silently substituted).
- **Project initiation contract.** Architecture synthesized from the legacy
  `ab_testing` engine (statistical baseline) and detectkit (architecture / DX),
  validated by a 5-lens adversarial subagent quorum (all approve-with-changes).
  See the master plan [`docs/ru/project-initiation-spec.md`](docs/ru/project-initiation-spec.md)
  and the [specs index](docs/specs/00-overview.md): architecture, statistics
  baseline + changes + legacy method catalogue, cumulative-intervals/compute
  strategy, declarative config, data contract & reporting, A/A false-positive
  matrix, CLI & DX, branding & site, and the quorum must-fix gate.
- **Development scaffolding** (this session): packaging (`pyproject.toml`,
  `setup.py`, `MANIFEST.in`, `requirements.txt`), `pre-commit`, GitHub workflows
  (CI, publish-to-PyPI on tags, website), a minimal importable `abkit` package with
  a working `abk` CLI entry point (`abk --version`), and smoke tests.

### Locked decisions
- Greenfield storage (legacy dashboard is reference only); statistical math
  preserved as a baseline then improved deliberately.
- Fixed-horizon CI by default with honest cumulative-peeking FPR in `abk validate`;
  sequential (always-valid) CIs opt-in.
- ClickHouse-first; PostgreSQL/MySQL supported. Read-only exposures.

_Pre-development: no PyPI release yet. The first tagged release will populate a
versioned section here. Roadmap: [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md)._
